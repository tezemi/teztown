== Weapon Changes ==
- Glock-18
    + Now fires in three-shot bursts.
    + Has increased firing delay.
    + Removed headshot multiplier.
    Gives the Glock a bit more of a utility, being a strong short-range pistol.

- M16
    + Significantly improved fire rate.
    + Damage has been decreased.
    + Clip size has been increased.
    + Removed the zoom.
    Standardizes the M16 a bit more, by making it more general purpose, as a rifle with decent damage, firing speed, and recoil, but not excelling in any aspect.

- Silenced USP
    + Improved fire rate.
    + Slightly decreased damage.
    + Reduced clip size.
    An unpopular choice for traitors due to the punishingly bad fire rate, which often made it impossible to follow up any kind of damage.

- SSG 08
    + The fire rate has been slightly improved.
    + No longer automatic.
    Makes getting a body shot a bit less punishing.

- XM1014
    + The fire rate has been significantly increased.
    + The damage has been significantly decreased.
    Makes it more reflective of the weapon its based off of, while making room for the other shotgun. Now works like an auto shotgun, firing quickly but doing little damage.


== New Weapons ==
- M3:        High damage shotgun with a large spread and slow fire rate.
- P228:      Fast-firing, but inaccurate pistol without a lot of ammo.
- MP5:       Functions similarly to the MAC-10, but has increased accuracy, at the cost of lower damage, and slightly lower firing speed.
- AK-47:     A high-damage, extremely accurate rifle, that has a high headshot multiplier, at the cost of having a low fire rate and extreme recoil.
- IMI Galil: An inaccurate rifle with a fast fire rate and increased ammo capacity.
- G3SG1:     A low damage auto-sniper that fires quickly, but has a normal headshot multiplier.
